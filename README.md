# Ravencoin-Rpc.Net
A .Net implementation of an interface to Ravencoin's JsonRPC

# Reason
I'm working on another project for Ravencoin, and I wasn't able to find a .NET implementation. So rolling my own.
A special thanks to https://github.com/cryptean/bitcoinlib. Some code and ideas were pulled from that repository. 

# State
Infancy. I think it's in a good enough state that another developer could pick it up and run with it. I'll be focusing on my needed calls as opposed to a comprehensive solution.
